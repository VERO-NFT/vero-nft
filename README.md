# Virtual Equivalents of Real Objects (VEROs)
## Intro
To learn about what VEROs are and how they can transform funding for museums, visit the VERO web site at https://vero-nft.org

## What extra attributes does a VERO have over a standard NFT?
* The associated 3D model is as faithful as it can be reasonably expected to be to the real object. But note that a collector could pay to upgrade their VERO when a higher resolution model becomes available through the use of a new or better imaging technology.
* The real object can be unambiguously identified through a unique identifier, e.g. museum barcode or universally unique identifier (UUID).
* The first transaction of the VERO is between the VERO purchaser and the owner of the real object at the time of sale. Any subsequent owners of the real object would be unable to produce and sell their own VERO from it. Therefore, the existence of the VERO should be made known to any prospective buyer of the real object prior to sale.
* The real object is trackable and remains demonstrably preserved. VEROs cease to exist (are invalidated) when their real object equivalents are destroyed. This firmly anchors the VERO to the real object. Furthermore, the omission of this criterion could lead to the frivolous generation of VEROs from any objects that could then be readily disposed of, which might encourage the generation of VEROs from poached and illegally collected specimens.
